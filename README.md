📘 ARM Projects Overview
This repository showcases a collection of embedded systems projects built on ARM architecture, specifically targeting the LPC2129 microcontroller. Each project demonstrates low-level hardware-software interaction, including UART communication, LCD interfacing, interrupt handling, and register-level programming. Designed for hands-on learning and real-world application, these implementations reflect a deep understanding of ARM7 architecture, peripheral control, and simulation workflows using Proteus. Ideal for students, developers, and engineers aiming to master embedded C and microcontroller-based system design.
