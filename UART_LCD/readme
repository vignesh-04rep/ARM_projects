ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This embedded systems project demonstrates real-time data transmission and display using UART communication integrated with an LCD module on the LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller. 
Designed for hands-on learning and industry-ready implementation, the code handles UART initialization, interrupt-driven data reception, and dynamic LCD updates. 
It showcases efficient register-level programming, interrupt handling, and peripheral interfacing â€” making it a valuable reference for embedded developers working with ARM architecture and Proteus simulation. 
Ideal for showcasing microcontroller proficiency in placement portfolios or technical interviews.
